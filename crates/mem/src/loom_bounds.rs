//! The bounds every loom model in the workspace explores under (Part 6, "Concurrency": loom on the
//! ring and handle cores; AC-0.7; T-0.3). One definition, so the memory crate's ring and handle
//! models and the runtime's parking model explore the same space in CI and on a laptop, and a
//! run's numbers (`docs/wip/concurrency.md`) mean the same thing everywhere.
//!
//! loom explores thread interleavings exhaustively up to a bound on preemptions (involuntary
//! thread switches) per execution, after Musuvathi and Qadeer's iterative context bounding
//! [A: "Iterative context bounding for systematic testing of multithreaded programs", PLDI 2007]:
//! every bug in their corpus surfaced within two preemptions, and loom's documentation recommends
//! two or three. Two is also what the parking protocol's store-buffering race needs (each side
//! preempted once, between its write and its read), so it is the smallest bound that can still
//! find a lost wake. An execution that runs past the branch cap is a livelock (a spin loop whose
//! condition never comes); loom turns it into a failure instead of a hang.
//!
//! Measured (2026-09-13, `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p slates-mem --release --lib loom
//! -- --nocapture`, Apple M5 Max, load average 6–7 with two other builds running): under the
//! bound, the one-producer ring explores 157 interleavings, the two contending producers 3,865
//! and the lapping producer 26, in 0.14 s together. With the bound lifted
//! (`LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS=255`, loom's widest, which no execution here reaches, so it is the
//! exhaustive run) the one-producer ring explores 6,096 — the same count the unbounded run at
//! c80b6f9 gave — and the lapping producer 192; the contending producers did not finish the
//! exhaustive run inside a 600 s box, which is what the bound is for. Every model's numbers are
//! recorded in `docs/wip/concurrency.md` with the command that produced them.
//!
//! loom's own environment variables stay loom's debugging interface: `LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS` and
//! `LOOM_MAX_BRANCHES` override the constants here for an investigation (a wider run, or the
//! exhaustive one), and `LOOM_CHECKPOINT_FILE` and `LOOM_LOCATION` isolate a failing iteration
//! as loom documents. Nothing narrows what CI runs: the lane sets no variable and gets the
//! constants.
