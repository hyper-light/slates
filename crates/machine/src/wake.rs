//! The wake probe (§4.1 "park→unpark latency"; D-10's spin-then-park; the derived constants of §4.1, §4.3
//! and §4.7): the **expected cost of parking** — how long a thread asleep in the kernel takes to run again
//! after another thread wakes it — measured with the placement the product runs under, and converged on
//! the statistic its consumers read.
//!
//! Each choice below is what the 2026-09-22 measurements decided
//! (`docs/bugs/2026-09-22-wake-probe-mixes-two-events-and-reports-an-unconverged-tail.md`):
//!
//! - **One event: a sleeping thread woken.** Before each wake the waiter is confirmed asleep in the
//!   kernel — its `/proc` state `S` on Linux, `thread_info`'s `TH_STATE_WAITING` on macOS; Windows has no
//!   per-thread query short of a system-wide snapshot, so there the waiter's own announcement stands in and
//!   the result says so. The probe it replaces timed every park/unpark round trip, whether the waiter was
//!   still running or asleep, and on the waker's CPU or another, so it mixed an on-CPU handoff (about
//!   0.45 µs) with a real wake (about 10 µs); thread placement holds for a whole run, so whole runs split
//!   between the two (a median of 417 ns and of 10,041 ns on the same two cores, a minute apart).
//! - **The placement production runs under.** Where the runtime pins its shards (Linux, Windows) the waiter
//!   is pinned to a shard core and the waker to the control core — the cores `slates-rt`'s `shard_cores`
//!   picks: the fastest class, its first core for control — one shard core per round; a sample the OS still
//!   ran on one CPU is not the event and is dropped (counted). Pinned this way, on a quiet host, the
//!   probe's median held at 8.9–10.8 µs over ten container runs (two and four CPUs, 2026-09-25) where the
//!   old probe's flipped between 416 ns and 10,041 ns. Where the OS will not pin (macOS: an affinity hint, refused on
//!   Apple silicon) production is unpinned too, so every sample is kept and the same-CPU share is recorded
//!   (63–92 % of wakes on Apple silicon ran on the waker's CPU across the prototype's and the probe's runs;
//!   the probe's pooled mean held at 2.03–2.49 µs over five runs).
//! - **The mean, not the median.** The spin-then-park rule spins for the expected cost of parking [A:
//!   Karlin, Manasse, McGeoch & Owicki, "Competitive randomized algorithms for nonuniform problems",
//!   Algorithmica 1994], and the heavy tail is part of that cost: on the same two pinned cores a spinning
//!   waiter's p99 was at most 209 ns while a parked one's was 285–639 µs (a halted virtual CPU waits on the
//!   host's scheduler), so the median understated the expected cost about threefold (mean 31–44 µs, median
//!   11–13 µs). The probe stops when the mean's 95 % bootstrap interval is within the crate's stopping-rule
//!   width ([`crate::stats::CONVERGED_WIDTH_PERMILLE`]) — the statistic consumed, not the median — or at
//!   its wall budget, reported `quick`. A heavy tail converges slowly (a coefficient of variation of five
//!   to seven on a virtual machine needs 38,000–75,000 wakes for an interval ten percent wide, where
//!   250 ms buys three to six thousand), which is why the
//!   runtime refines this estimate from its own wakes after boot (`slates-rt`'s wake-cost estimate).
//! - **Rounds.** [`WAKE_ROUNDS`] rounds, each with a fresh waiter thread (and, pinned, its own shard core).
//!   A run-long mode is invisible to a within-run interval — every old run converged tightly and runs still
//!   differed 23× — so the rounds are compared, and disagree when a round's median interval misses the
//!   pooled one by more than the probe's own precision ([`rounds_agree`]). Medians, not means: a placement
//!   or state mode moves the median by multiples (0.4 µs against 10 µs), while a heavy tail's rare events
//!   scatter a short round's mean without moving its median — on the Linux containers the round means
//!   disagreed in six runs of eight with the pair pinned, and no mode in sight. Round medians still
//!   disagree when the host's own load drifts during the probe (five runs of ten on a desktop VM): that is
//!   reported, the profile lists the probe as degraded (`wake.rounds`), and nothing is sized from it.
//! - **The p99 is kept for its one consumer**: the runtime's inbound ring, sized against the tail at its
//!   overflow target (§4.1 "ring depth"). Everything else derives from the mean.
