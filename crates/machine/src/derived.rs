//! A value with its provenance.

//! R3 says every parameter is measured from the machine or the data and derived by a stated
//! algorithm. In code that means a tunable is never a bare number: it is a [`Derived`] carrying the
//! formula that produced it and the names of the measured anchors it used, so the boot log can
//! print `value = formula(anchors)` for every constant and a reader can check the arithmetic.
//! The `derived!` macro is the one form the literal check (`cargo xtask literals`) accepts for a
//! numeric literal in shipped code.
