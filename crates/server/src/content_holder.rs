//! The holder's side of the content plane (§4.10 "Content replication", §4.8 mechanism 1): one content
//! request answered on the shard that keeps this node's hold. Authority for the object comes first
//! (AUD-29-45), then the retention rule at the door (`crate::content_retention::admits`), the verified hold,
//! and the retention rule over what a held put superseded (AUD-29-43). The fleet's record session and the
//! daemon's test hook both serve through [`serve`], so a test drives the production path with only the
//! authority decision replaced. An acknowledgement is answered only once the shard's recovery image carrying
//! the put is committed into anchor-owned RAM (AUD-29-59), so a warm restart keeps every acknowledged
//! replica.
