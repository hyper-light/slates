//! Parking a shard and kicking it awake: the protocol between a shard about to wait in its driver
//! and whoever sends it a message from another thread (§4.3, "wake from another shard enqueues
//! (slot, generation) on the target's ring and kicks the driver"; §4.7 "Wake strategy": a sender
//! kicks only a parked shard, so a message to a spinning shard costs no syscall, and the saving
//! is counted). The shard announces that it is about to park, then re-checks its inboxes; a
//! sender publishes its message, then checks the announcement. Each side writes and then reads,
//! the store-buffering shape, so the two reads must be ordered against the two writes by one
//! total order or both can miss: the shard sees no message and parks, the sender sees no
//! announcement and skips the kick, and the message waits for a wake that never comes.
//!
//! Each side therefore fences with `SeqCst` between its write and its read. That is the C++20
//! fence rule ([B: `[atomics.order]`, the fence–fence case]: with a `SeqCst` fence after the
//! write on one thread and a `SeqCst` fence before the read on the other, whichever fence comes
//! first in the total order, the later thread's read observes the earlier thread's write), and
//! it holds whatever ordering the message's own publication used — the multi-producer ring
//! publishes with `Release`, the control flag with `SeqCst`. A `SeqCst` store and load on the
//! announcement alone were not enough: the ring's `Release` publication takes no part in the
//! announcement's total order, so the abstract model lets both reads miss, and x86 realizes it
//! by reordering the plain store of the publication past the plain load of the announcement
//! through its store buffer (a `SeqCst` load is a plain `mov` there; only a `SeqCst` store gets
//! the locked instruction). loom found the lost wake in the first executions it explored
//! (`docs/bugs/2026-09-13-parked-shard-loses-a-foreign-wake.md`); arm64 orders a store-release
//! before a later load-acquire and was never exposed.
//!
//! Under `--cfg loom` the model in this module drives exactly this code: one sender publishing
//! into the shard's multi-producer ring against one shard parking, with loom's `Notify` standing
//! in for the driver's kick (sticky like an eventfd count or an `EVFILT_USER` trigger, spurious
//! like a real `kevent` return); a lost wake is a shard blocked with no runnable thread left,
//! which loom reports as a deadlock (AC-0.7).
