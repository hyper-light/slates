//! A shard thread's CPU clock, readable from any thread of the process (§4.14: an observation's budget is counted in
//! the observed shard's own time). A shard records a handle to its own clock as it starts
//! ([`crate::registry::record_cpu_clock`]); an observer reads it ([`crate::registry::shard_cpu`]) to tell a starved
//! shard, which keeps consuming CPU, from a wedged one, which consumes none. Measured 2026-10-03 in a Linux container
//! under 108 CPU burners on 18 cores: shards whose observations timed out were runnable (state R, preempted), not
//! blocked, and the 10 s wall budget read their starvation as a fault
//! (`docs/bugs/2026-10-03-an-observation-read-a-starved-shard-as-wedged.md`).
//!
//! A reading carries the CPU time the thread has run ([`CpuReading::spent_ns`], what the budget is charged) and a count
//! that grows whenever it runs at all ([`CpuReading::progress`], what tells it ran during a window):
//! - Linux: `pthread_getcpuclockid` of the calling thread, read with `clock_gettime` (any thread may read it); the
//!   progress is the time itself.
//! - macOS: the calling thread's Mach port (`pthread_mach_thread_np`), read with `thread_info(THREAD_BASIC_INFO)` (user
//!   plus system time); the progress is the time itself.
//! - Windows: the calling thread's id, opened for each read with query rights only. The time is `GetThreadTimes`'
//!   kernel plus user time, which the scheduler charges a tick at a time (15.6 ms by default), so a thread that ran less
//!   than a tick in a window may show none; the progress is `QueryThreadCycleTime`, the cycles the thread has run,
//!   exact [B: Microsoft Learn, "QueryThreadCycleTime", "GetThreadTimes"].
//! - Miri: no clock; the observation keeps its wall budget there.
//!
//! The handle is a `u64`, nonzero when recorded.
