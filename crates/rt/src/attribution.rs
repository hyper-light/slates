//! Who held a long poll (§4.3, the long-step count; A-31). A poll that runs past the step quantum by the
//! wall clock was held either by its task — it ran past the quantum on the CPU, or it waited inside a
//! call (blocked in the kernel, such as the base plane's synchronous `pread` on a cold page cache, or
//! yielding the thread to a full peer ring) — or by the host: the thread was runnable and off the CPU,
//! preempted by the operating system or its virtual CPU stolen by the hypervisor. The wall clock counts
//! both the same. The quantum is the expected wake, a few microseconds (§4.1: a mean of 2.0–3.3 µs on
//! Apple silicon and 10.7–21.7 µs in a Linux container, 2026-09-25), while a time slice handed to another
//! runnable thread is far longer (Linux's EEVDF base slice is 0.75 ms, `sysctl_sched_base_slice` in
//! `kernel/sched/fair.c`, from memory). So by the wall clock alone, every preemption of a correct poll
//! counted as the bounded-work rule's bug signal.
//!
//! The shard reads the calling thread's account ([`ThreadAccount`]) at the start of a window and at the
//! end of a long poll: its CPU time (`CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` on Linux and macOS) and, on Linux, its
//! voluntary context switches (`getrusage(RUSAGE_THREAD)`'s `ru_nvcsw`: the thread blocked in a call;
//! Linux counts a preemption and a `sched_yield` as involuntary). The runtime reports its own yields
//! inside a poll (a send to a full ring) to the window. Measured in a Linux container on this Mac (Docker,
//! four CPUs, 2026-09-25, best of five rounds of 200,000 calls): the CPU clock 155–161 ns and `getrusage`
//! 130–134 ns; on Apple silicon the CPU clock 107–129 ns (2026-09-22). That is too dear for every poll,
//! so the shard reads only at the end of a poll that already ran long, and — while a long poll went
//! unattributed for want of a window — at each step's start and each wait's end ([`Tracker`]); a busy
//! period that runs no long poll stops the readings. macOS counts no per-thread voluntary switches, so a
//! poll off the CPU there is unattributed unless the runtime itself yielded in it. Windows keeps
//! per-thread times at the scheduler tick (about 15.6 ms), so no account is read there and every long
//! poll is unattributed.
//!
//! [`attribute`] and [`Tracker`] are cfg-free and unit-tested on every host; the readings are paired
//! `#[cfg]` functions.
