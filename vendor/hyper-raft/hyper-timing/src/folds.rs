//! What a node measures of itself and of the fleet for its detectors (`docs/timing.md` §2.4,
//! §2.6): the lateness of its own timed waits (the granularity `G`), the cost of the flush its
//! sender makes before each heartbeat (the stability floor `E[flush] + G`), and the fleet's
//! failures over its exposure (the MTBF).
//!
//! Each is a mean, held as a count and an exact sum: two words, whatever the number of samples. The
//! means are what the floors need. `G` floors the queues the waits feed (the sender's schedule, the
//! detector's checks), whose stability and expected delay depend on the mean service time
//! (Lindley 1952), and a sender that flushes before each heartbeat is stable only while its mean
//! service is below the interval.
