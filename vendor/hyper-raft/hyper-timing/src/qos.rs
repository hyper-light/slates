//! A link's failure detector and a group's election span, chosen from measurement to minimize the
//! time a group cannot commit (`docs/timing.md` §2.2–§2.3).
//!
//! The detector is Chen, Toueg and Aguilera's NFD-E (DSN 2000; IEEE Transactions on Computers
//! 51(5), 2002): heartbeats every `η`, trusted while one is fresh, freshness at the expected arrival
//! plus a margin `α`. A crash is detected within `E(D) + α + η` (their Theorem 4). Its mistakes are
//! bounded from the measured arrivals alone, through the one-sided (Cantelli) inequality
//! `Pr(X − E ≥ x) ≤ V / (V + x²)`, which holds for any distribution with that mean and variance, in
//! one of two forms:
//! - **per arrival**, the node-pair stream's ([`configure_arrivals`], [`arrival_detector_at`],
//!   [`lateness_bound`]): a freshness point errs only when the heartbeat taken after it comes past
//!   it, so the detector errs at most once a heartbeat taken, with chance at most
//!   `β(α) = u + (1 − u)·V/(V + (α − μ)²)` for `α > μ`, over the lateness `ℓ` of each heartbeat
//!   taken past its expected arrival (mean `μ`, variance `V`) and the chance `u` that one is past
//!   every lateness seen ([`Arrivals`], `docs/timing.md` §2.2). One factor, whatever the heartbeats
//!   the margin holds: it assumes no independence between them, so any margin is admitted, and a
//!   heartbeat the sender skipped or the network lost is the next one's lateness;
//! - **Theorem 7's product**, a SWIM member's probe detector's (`hyper-swim`, §2.7; [`detector_at`],
//!   [`mistake_bound`]): `β = Π_{j=0}^{k₀} (V + p_L·x_j²) / (V + x_j²)`, `x_j = α − jη`, over the
//!   heartbeats still fresh, `k₀ = ⌈α/η⌉ − 1`, with the loss `p_L` and the delay's variance. The
//!   product takes the heartbeats in the margin as independent, which the traces refute below the
//!   correlation time `T_c` ([`Floors`]); below it the margin holds one heartbeat.
//!
//! Chen et al. configure `η` and `α` from requirements an application states. Here they minimize
//! what those requirements stand for, a group's expected unavailability
//! `U = (E(D) + α + η + T_E) / MTBF + T_E · β / η`: an election `T_E` after each detected crash of
//! the leader's node, and one after each false suspicion, at most one an interval. By Little's law
//! (Little 1961) `U` is the mean number of elections in progress, so it bounds the share of time
//! one is: at one or more it promises no availability at all, and is no configuration.
//!
//! The election span `W` minimizes the expected time to a leader. A suspicion starts each of the
//! `s` available voters' campaigns after a delay drawn uniformly from `[0, W)`; the vote splits when
//! `c = s − ⌊n/2⌋ + 1` or more of them start within the one-way latency `l` of the first (Ongaro,
//! dissertation §9.2). The spacing of uniform order statistics `T_(c) − T_(1)` is
//! `Beta(c − 1, s − c + 2)` (David and Nagaraja, *Order Statistics*, 3rd ed., 2003, §2.5), whose
//! distribution function at integer parameters is a binomial tail:
//! `Pr(split) = Pr(Binomial(s, l/W) ≥ c − 1)`. Elections needed are geometric (§9.3).
//!
//! Times are seconds as `f64` inside the arithmetic and `Duration` at the edges.
